# ðŸ“¦ Python Learning Progress â€“ Rajender

## âœ… Day 01 â€” Basics

### âœ… Variables & Types

- Learned to declare variables dynamically (no type keywords like Dart)
- `name = "demon slayer"`
- Used `type()` to check variable types

### âœ… Printing

- Used `print(name)`
- Printed multiple items: `print(type(releasedData), name)`

- Defined a function with `def`  
  Example:
  ```python
  def reverse_string(s):
      ...
  ```

Day 02 â€” Collections & Functions
âœ… Lists
Created list: numbers = [10, 20, 30]

Appended items with numbers.append(40)

Loop over items: for n in numbers

Loop by index: for i in range(len(numbers))

Wrote sum and find max functions manually.

âœ… Tuples
Immutable ordered collections.

Cannot change, append, or remove after creation.

âœ… Sets
Unique, unordered collection.

Used add() to insert.

Used not in to manually avoid duplicates.

Understood set automatically removes duplicates.

âœ… Dictionaries
Keyâ€“value pairs: {'name': 'Rajender', 'age': 26}

Access: person['name']

Safe access: person.get('name')

Add new key: person['email'] = ...

Loop with:

python
Copy
Edit
for key, val in person.items():
print(key, val)
